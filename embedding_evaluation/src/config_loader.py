"""Minimal, self-contained config loader for eVTOL-Embedding-Evaluation.

Finds ``config.yaml`` relative to this file, loads it, and resolves every path
under ``paths:`` to an absolute :class:`pathlib.Path` (relative paths are taken
relative to the folder root — the directory that contains config.yaml).

Optionally reads a ``.env`` at the folder root for ``DRIVE_PATH`` so absolute
data locations can live outside version control.
